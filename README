FOR MARKETERS:
Please, if you're using the code for a marketing campaign, attribute it to us properly, the creators. Not just in code.
We have put in a lot of work for this and it would really help us. Created by Rootof Creations HB <rootof.com>

The code is in asteroids.js, and if you feel like pushing any updates it would really help if you updated the asteroids.min.js to match your commit.
